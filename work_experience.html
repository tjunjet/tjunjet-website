              2021. This online course was offered by Stanford University during
              the COVID-19 pandemic. The course is a 6-week introduction to Python
               programming using materials from the first half of Stanfordâ€™s
               CS106A course.

              I was a Platoon Commander in Echo Company, 10th Command, Control,
              Communications, Computers and Intelligence (10 C4I) Battalion. As
              a Platoon Commander, I was in charge of planning real-time security
              operations for major events.
              <br>
              <br>
              Throughout my term, I studied our system's capabilities in depth and
               created fundamental lesson slides for future planners and operators.
               I also wrote mathematical programs related to signals to supplement
               operational requirements. Furthermore, as the only Platoon Commander
                for a few months, I took charge of all training and administrative
                matters for all three platoons simultaneously.
