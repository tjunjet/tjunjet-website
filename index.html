            Section leader for Stanford University's Code In Place, April - May
            2021. This online course was offered by Stanford University during
            the COVID-19 pandemic. The course is a 6-week introduction to Python
             programming using materials from the first half of Stanford’s
             CS106A course.
             <br>
             <br>
             As a volunteer section leader, I prepared and taught a weekly
             discussion section of 8-10 students to supplement professors'
             lectures.

            I was a Platoon Commander in Echo Company, 10th Command, Control,
            Communications, Computers and Intelligence (10 C4I) Battalion. As
            a Platoon Commander, I was in charge of planning real-time security
            operations for major events.
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout my term, I studied our system's capabilities in depth and
             created fundamental lesson slides for future planners and operators.
             I also wrote mathematical programs related to signals to supplement
             operational requirements. Furthermore, as the only Platoon Commander
              for a few months, I took charge of all training and administrative
              matters for all three platoons simultaneously.
